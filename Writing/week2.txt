Week 2

Monday 6/25:

Jiayi and I prepared sensitivity analysis and filtering procedure for 1pm presentation
Generated more graphs and finished up powerpoint

Presented Powerpoint, received feedback:
- Good visuals because they show our results and actually give info others can use
- TODO: Make a histogram of headings, perhaps over a week or a month. We expect 4 peaks at 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees
because most things are going N/E/S/W, so we should see if that is the case. Divide into 36 or 360 bins
    - also do a histogram of heading with 10 degree increments for bins
    - compare headings from different providers - we want to see if there's a provider that always has 0 heading! or
    anything else strange
- TODO: Understand trip lengths. Why do we have 700km trips? Is it bc of long trips or is it wrong?
